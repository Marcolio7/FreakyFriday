        <h2>Floorball rules</h2>
        <p> In floorball there is a lot of different rules to think of while playing. <br> You always have to carry the right equipment to stay on the field.
            <br> That is equipments such as gym shoes, a stick and your team kit. <br> You are not allowed to push other opponents in other ways than shoulder against shoulder <br>
            You are allowed to kick the ball only once each time you have it <br> and you are allowed to pass the ball to a teammate with your feet. <br>
            To hit other opponents directly at the stick is not allowed, <br> you will have to take the ball away from them in a clean way.
        </p>
        <h2>Positions/pitch</h2>
        <p>On a floorballpitch you have five different positions as well as a goalkeeper. <br> The positions you have can you see on the pitch under here. <br>
            The two X'es in front of the goal are both right and left back, the X in the middle is called a center <br> and the two X'es in front is called runners or wingers.
